# **App Name**: BioHerb Landing

## Core Features:

- Landing Page Structure: Develop a single-page landing structure including a header with navigation, a hero section with a product image and CTA, features, customer testimonials, pricing, FAQs, contact, order form, and a footer.
- Contact & Order Form: Include a contact form with fields for name, phone number, and address. On submitting the form, the app calls a tool function which validates data and transmits the form submission data automatically to the user's Telegram bot via API by populating TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID. (Backend-less submission using Javascript).
- Product Information Display: Visually present product details, benefits, and usage instructions on the landing page using a clear layout.
- Customer Testimonials Section: Include a section to display customer reviews with avatars to build trust.
- FAQ Section: Implement a FAQ section addressing common questions about the product.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the landing page is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Natural Green (#8FBC8F) to reflect the herbal nature of the product.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), to establish a clean, herbal backdrop.
- Accent color: Light Orange (#E9967A) for CTAs and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya' serif with an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel. Its natural curves support the earthy design without the app feeling 'too' earthy.
- Use of minimalistic and natural-themed icons.
- Clean, organized, and user-friendly single-page layout with clear sections.
- Subtle animations on scroll to enhance user experience without being distracting.
